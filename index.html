        <div class="disease">
          <p>
            Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and its functioning. It is also known as cardiovascular disease and includes various disorders that can affect the blood vessels (arteries and veins) and the heart itself. It is a broad term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is the leading cause of death globally, accounting for millions of deaths each year. Heart disease can manifest in various forms, each with its own causes, risk factors, symptoms, and treatment approaches.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Types of Heart Diseases</h2>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h3>
          <p>Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease. It occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart become narrow or blocked due to the buildup of plaque. This can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and other complications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Heart Failure</h3>
          <p>Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure, happens when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. This can result in fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and fluid retention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Arrhythmia</h3>
          <p>Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms. It can cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly. Some arrhythmias may not cause noticeable symptoms, while others can lead to dizziness, palpitations, or even fainting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Valvular Heart Disease</h3>
          <p>Valvular heart disease occurs when one or more of the heart's valves are damaged or diseased, affecting blood flow through the heart. Common types include mitral valve prolapse, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. Symptoms can vary depending on the specific valve involved.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Cardiomyopathy</h3>
          <p>Cardiomyopathy is a disease that affects the heart muscle, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. It can be inherited or acquired due to other factors such as high blood pressure or viral infections. Symptoms may include fatigue, breathlessness, and swelling in the legs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Pericardial Disease</h3>
          <p>Pericardial disease refers to conditions that affect the pericardium, the sac-like membrane surrounding the heart. It can include pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), pericardial effusion (abnormal accumulation of fluid), or constrictive pericarditis (scarring and thickening of the pericardium). Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Congenital Heart Defects</h3>
          <p>Congenital heart defects are structural abnormalities present at birth. They affect the heart's structure and functioning, leading to various types of heart disease, such as abnormal heart valves, septal defects (holes in the heart walls), or malformations of the heart chambers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Causes of Heart Diseases</h2>
        <div class="disease">
          <h3>Atherosclerosis</h3>
          <p>Atherosclerosis is a major underlying cause of many types of heart disease. It occurs when there is a buildup of plaque consisting of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances on the inner walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, restricts blood flow, and can lead to various cardiovascular conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
        <h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>
          <p>Atherosclerosis is a major underlying cause of many types of heart disease. It occurs when there is a buildup of plaque consisting of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances on the inner walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, restricts blood flow, and can lead to various cardiovascular conditions.Persistent high blood pressure (hypertension) can damage the arteries over time, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Uncontrolled hypertension can strain the heart and increase the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and other heart-related complications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="disease">
        <h3>High Cholesterol</h3>
        <p>High levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, can contribute to the development of plaque in the arteries. The presence of high triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, known as "good" cholesterol, also increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="disease">
      <h3>Smoking</h3>
        <p>Tobacco smoking, including both active and passive smoking, is a significant risk factor for heart disease. It damages the blood vessels, reduces oxygen supply to the heart, increases blood pressure, and promotes the formation of blood clots, all of which contribute to the development of heart disease.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="disease">
      <h3>Physical Inactivity</h3>
        <p>A sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular physical activity increase the risk of heart disease. Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and strengthen the heart and blood vessels.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="disease">
      <h3>Family History and Genetics</h3>
        <p>Having a family history of heart disease, especially if a close relative developed heart disease at an early age, increases the risk. Certain genetic factors and inherited conditions can also predispose individuals to specific types of heart disease, such as familial hypercholesterolemia or certain cardiomyopathies</p>
      </div>
      <div class="disease">
      <h3>Other Factors</h3>
        <p>Additional factors that can contribute to heart disease include stress, excessive alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, sleep apnea, unhealty diet, obesity, diabetes , smoking, and certain underlying medical conditions like chronic kidney disease or autoimmune disorders.</p>
